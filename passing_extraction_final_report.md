# FBref Passing Data Extraction - Final Report

## Executive Summary
Successfully extracted and populated real FBref passing statistics into the NWSL database, replacing placeholder zeros with actual match data.

## Key Achievements

### Before Extraction
- **Total Records**: 45,135
- **Records with Data**: 0 (0%)
- **All Values**: Zeros (total_completed=0, total_attempted=0, assists=0)

### After Extraction
- **Total Records**: 45,135
- **Records with Data**: 27,541 (61.0%)
- **Records with Zeros**: 17,594 (39.0%)
- **Average Pass Completion**: 70.8%

## Extraction Statistics

### Processing Summary
- **HTML Files Processed**: 920
- **Files Skipped** (already had data): 9
- **Passing Tables Found**: 1,840
- **Player Records Updated**: 27,560

### Data Volume
- **Total Passes Completed**: 634,799
- **Total Passes Attempted**: 854,821
- **Overall Completion Rate**: 74.3%
- **Total Assists Recorded**: 1,550

### Processing Performance
- **Total Time**: 4 minutes 40 seconds
- **Processing Rate**: ~197 files per minute
- **Records Updated per Second**: ~98

## Technical Implementation

### Extraction Methodology
1. **HTML Parsing**: Used BeautifulSoup to parse FBref HTML match files
2. **Table Identification**: Located tables with pattern `stats_{team_hex_id}_passing`
3. **Player Mapping**: Extracted FBref hex IDs from `data-append-csv` attributes
4. **Assists Integration**: Combined data from summary tables for assist statistics
5. **Database Updates**: Batch processed updates with commit after each match

### Key Features
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checked for existing data before processing
- **Error Handling**: Continued processing on individual failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates every 10 files
- **Batch Processing**: Processed files in batches of 50 for efficiency

## Sample Data Quality

### High-Volume Passers (>80 attempts in a match)
- Player 23b17daa: Multiple matches with 85-93% completion rate
- Player f8e41f9d: 112/126 passes (88.9% completion)
- Player 787e8bfd: Consistent 88-91% completion across matches
- Player 7f140cb9: 109/116 passes (94.0% completion)

## Remaining Work

### Records Still with Zeros (17,594)
Potential reasons:
1. **Older Matches**: Pre-2017 matches may not have detailed passing data
2. **Missing HTML Files**: Some matches may not have been scraped
3. **Incomplete Data**: Some FBref pages may lack passing tables
4. **Goalkeeper Records**: Many goalkeeper entries may naturally have minimal passing data

## Database Schema Note
Current `match_player_passing` table only stores:
- `total_completed`
- `total_attempted`
- `assists`

FBref provides additional rich data that could be captured:
- Pass distance metrics
- Progressive passes
- Key passes
- Expected assists (xA)
- Short/medium/long pass breakdowns
- Passes into final third/penalty area

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Remaining Records**: Investigate the 17,594 records still with zeros
2. **Schema Enhancement**: Consider expanding the table to capture more FBref metrics
3. **Data Validation**: Cross-reference a sample of records with source HTML for accuracy
4. **Historical Data**: Prioritize extracting data for recent seasons first
5. **Automated Updates**: Implement regular extraction for new matches

## Files Generated
- `extract_fbref_passing_data.py`: Initial extraction script
- `extract_fbref_passing_batch.py`: Optimized batch processing script
- `passing_batch_report_20250811_114700.txt`: Detailed extraction log

## Conclusion
Successfully transformed the `match_player_passing` table from a placeholder state to containing real, meaningful passing statistics for 61% of all records. The extraction process was efficient and reliable, providing a solid foundation for football analytics on the NWSL database.
