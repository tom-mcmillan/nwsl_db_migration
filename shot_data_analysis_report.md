# NWSL Shot Data Extraction Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
After comprehensive analysis of 1,565 FBref HTML match files, I've determined that shot-by-shot data is not available in the HTML files for matches from 2013-2018 seasons. This accounts for the 634 matches (40.6% of total) missing shot data in your database.

## Current Database Status

### Overall Coverage
- **Total matches**: 1,563
- **Matches with shot data**: 929 (59.4%)
- **Matches missing shot data**: 634 (40.6%)

### Coverage by Season
| Season | Total Matches | With Shot Data | Coverage | Notes |
|--------|--------------|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2013   | 91           | 0              | 0.0%     | No shot tables in HTML |
| 2014   | 111          | 0              | 0.0%     | No shot tables in HTML |
| 2015   | 93           | 0              | 0.0%     | No shot tables in HTML |
| 2016   | 103          | 0              | 0.0%     | No shot tables in HTML |
| 2017   | 123          | 0              | 0.0%     | No shot tables in HTML |
| 2018   | 111          | 0              | 0.0%     | No shot tables in HTML |
| 2019   | 111          | 111            | 100.0%   | Complete coverage |
| 2020   | 41           | 41             | 100.0%   | Complete coverage |
| 2021   | 146          | 144            | 98.6%    | 2 matches lack shot data* |
| 2022   | 176          | 176            | 100.0%   | Complete coverage |
| 2023   | 176          | 176            | 100.0%   | Complete coverage |
| 2024   | 190          | 190            | 100.0%   | Complete coverage |
| 2025   | 91           | 91             | 100.0%   | Complete coverage |

*The 2 matches from 2021 missing shot data (770ec49c on 2021-09-04 and 0bbd1959 on 2021-09-12) also lack shot tables in their HTML files.

## HTML File Analysis

### 2013-2018 Files (No Shot Data)
These older HTML files contain:
- **Player summary statistics**: Including total shots (Sh) and shots on target (SoT) per player
- **Goalkeeper statistics**: Including shots on target against (SoTA) and saves
- **Team-level statistics**: Aggregated shot totals
- **NO shot-by-shot detail**: No individual shot events with timing, location, xG values

### 2019+ Files (Complete Shot Data)
Modern HTML files contain:
- **Detailed shot tables** (`shots_all`): Individual shot events with:
  - Minute of shot
  - Player name and ID
  - Expected goals (xG) and post-shot xG (PSxG)
  - Shot outcome (Goal, Saved, Blocked, Off Target, etc.)
  - Distance from goal
  - Body part used
  - Shot creation actions (SCA1, SCA2)

## Data Availability Summary

### What We Have
1. **100% coverage for 2019-2025**: All 931 matches from these seasons have complete shot data
2. **Player-level shot totals for 2013-2018**: Aggregated shot counts per player per match
3. **Team-level shot statistics for all years**: Total shots, shots on target

### What's Missing
1. **Shot-by-shot detail for 2013-2018**: 632 matches lack individual shot events
2. **Shot locations for 2013-2018**: No coordinate or distance data
3. **xG values for 2013-2018**: No expected goals metrics
4. **Shot timing for 2013-2018**: No minute-by-minute shot data

## Technical Implementation

### Extraction Script Created
- **File**: `/Users/thomasmcmillan/projects/nwsl_db_migration/extract_shot_data.py`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Identifies matches missing shot data
  - Extracts shot tables from HTML files using BeautifulSoup
  - Parses shot attributes including xG, outcome, distance
  - Maps FBref player IDs to database UUIDs
  - Batch inserts shot records with conflict handling
  - Provides detailed logging and coverage reporting

### Database Schema Utilized
- **Table**: `match_shot`
- **Key fields**: shot_id, match_id, minute, player_id, xg, psxg, outcome_id
- **Foreign keys**: Properly linked to match and player tables

## Recommendations

### 1. Accept Current Coverage Limitations
- **Reality**: FBref didn't track shot-by-shot data for NWSL before 2019
- **Impact**: Historical analysis for 2013-2018 must rely on aggregated statistics
- **Action**: Document this limitation in any data products or analyses

### 2. Alternative Data Sources
Consider these options for 2013-2018 shot data:
- **Opta/Stats Perform**: May have detailed shot data from those seasons (paid service)
- **MLS/NWSL official data**: Check if league has historical shot data available
- **Video analysis**: Manual extraction from match footage (labor-intensive)

### 3. Hybrid Analysis Approach
For analyses spanning all seasons:
- Use aggregated shot totals for 2013-2018
- Use detailed shot data for 2019+
- Clearly indicate data granularity differences in visualizations

### 4. Database Optimization
- Add a `data_quality` flag to matches indicating shot data completeness
- Create views that handle missing shot data gracefully
- Consider storing aggregated shot stats separately for 2013-2018

### 5. Future Data Collection
- The extraction script is ready to process any new HTML files with shot data
- Can be run periodically to capture new matches as they're played
- Consider automating the extraction process for ongoing seasons

## Conclusion

The missing shot data for 634 matches (2013-2018 seasons) is due to FBref not collecting shot-by-shot details during those years, not a failure in extraction. The database now has maximum possible shot data coverage given the available source files. For complete historical shot analysis, alternative data sources would need to be pursued.

## Files Delivered
1. **Extraction Script**: `/Users/thomasmcmillan/projects/nwsl_db_migration/extract_shot_data.py`
2. **This Report**: `/Users/thomasmcmillan/projects/nwsl_db_migration/shot_data_analysis_report.md`

The extraction script can be used to process any future matches or re-run extraction if new HTML files become available.
