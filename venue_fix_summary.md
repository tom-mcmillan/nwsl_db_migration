# NWSL Database Unknown Venues Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified
- **49 "Unknown venue" records** in the venue table with names like "Unidentified Venue (hex_id)"
- These venues were referenced by 1,261 matches in the match_venue_weather table
- The hex IDs in parentheses were original FBref venue identifiers

## Root Cause
The unknown venues were duplicates of existing venue records. The match_venue_weather table contained the correct physical addresses, but was linked to duplicate "Unidentified" venue records instead of the proper venue entries.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Address-based matching**: Used the venue_location field in match_venue_weather to match unknown venues with existing proper venue records
2. **Duplicate resolution**: When multiple venue names existed for the same address (due to stadium name changes), selected the most current/appropriate name
3. **Data migration**: Updated all 1,261 match_venue_weather records to point to the correct venue IDs
4. **Cleanup**: Deleted the 49 unused "Unidentified Venue" records

## Key Findings

### Top Unknown Venues Fixed (by match count):
1. **Providence Park** (Portland, OR) - 135 matches
2. **WakeMed Soccer Park** (Cary, NC) - 72 matches  
3. **SeatGeek Stadium** (Bridgeview, IL) - 71 matches
4. **Lynn Family Stadium** (Louisville, KY) - 61 matches
5. **Shell Energy Stadium** (Houston, TX) - 58 matches

- Houston: BBVA Stadium → PNC Stadium → Shell Energy Stadium
- Orlando: Orlando City Stadium → Exploria Stadium → Inter&Co Stadium
- Portland: Jeld-Wen Field → Providence Park
- Chicago area: Toyota Park → SeatGeek Stadium

## Final State
- **Total venues**: 56 (down from 105)
- **Unknown venues**: 0 (down from 49)
- **All 1,261 matches** now correctly linked to proper venues
- **21 duplicate venue entries** remain unused but preserved for historical reference

## Verification
All matches now have proper venue assignments with correct names and addresses. The fix was implemented using SQL UPDATE and DELETE operations within a transaction to ensure data integrity.
