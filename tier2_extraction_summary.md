## Technical Implementation

### Optimizations Applied
1. **Bulk Insert Operations:** Used PostgreSQL's `execute_batch` with 1,000-record batches
2. **Connection Tuning:** Disabled synchronous commits and increased work memory
3. **Efficient Caching:** Pre-loaded all team, player, and match mappings
4. **Smart Table Recognition:** Automated detection of FBref table patterns
5. **Parallel Processing:** Extracted all 5 table types per match in single pass

### Data Extraction Strategy
- Focused on 2019-2025 seasons where advanced statistics are available
- Handled multi-level column headers from pandas DataFrames
- Created match_player records on-demand when missing
