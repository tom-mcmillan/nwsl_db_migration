# NWSL Database Data Consistency Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-08-12
## Database: nwsl_data (PostgreSQL)

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. xG Inconsistency Issues
**Initial Problem:**
- `match` table: xg_home and xg_away values were inconsistent with aggregated shot data
- `match_team_performance` table: xg field was NULL despite having shot data available
- `match_shot` table: Contains detailed xG values that weren't being properly aggregated

**Example (Match 07c68416):**
- Before Fix:
  - match table: xg_home=1.8, xg_away=1.0
  - match_shot aggregated: Angel City=1.77, Royals=1.03
  - match_team_performance: xg=NULL for both teams

- After Fix:
  - match table: xg_home=1.77, xg_away=1.03
  - match_team_performance: Angel City xg=1.77, Royals xg=1.03
  - All values now consistent across tables

### 2. Goal Consistency Issues
**Initial Problem:**
- Goals and goals_against fields in `match_team_performance` were inconsistent with `match` table
- Some records had NULL or incorrect values

**Resolution:**
- Updated 42 records to ensure goals and goals_against properly reflect match results
- Enforced bidirectional consistency (home goals = away goals_against and vice versa)

### 3. Missing Team Performance Records
**Initial Problem:**
- 28 matches had incomplete team performance records (missing one or both team records)

**Current Status:**
- These matches still need team performance records created
- Represents 1.79% of all matches
- Requires additional data extraction from source

## Final Validation Results

### Overall Data Quality Metrics
```
Check Type              | Matches | Consistent | Rate
------------------------|---------|------------|--------
xG Consistency         | 927     | 927        | 100.00%
Goal Consistency       | 1509    | 1439       | 95.36%
Team Records Complete  | 1563    | 1535       | 98.21%
```

### Data Updates Applied
- **927 xG values updated** in match_team_performance table
- **928 xG values updated** in match table
- **42 goal/goals_against corrections** in match_team_performance
- **3 database views created** for ongoing monitoring
- **2 triggers implemented** for data integrity enforcement

## Database Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Validation Views Created
- `v_xg_consistency_check`: Monitors xG consistency across tables
- `v_goal_consistency_check`: Validates goal data consistency
- `v_match_team_record_check`: Ensures proper team performance records

### 2. Data Integrity Triggers
- `ensure_two_team_records`: Prevents more than 2 team performance records per match
- `validate_xg_on_update`: Warns when xG updates don't match shot data

### 3. Validation Functions
- `check_match_team_performance_count()`: Validates team record count
- `validate_xg_consistency()`: Ensures xG values match aggregated shot data

## Key Files Created

1. **`fix_xg_data_consistency.sql`**
   - Main migration script that fixes all data inconsistencies
   - Idempotent and safe to re-run
   - Includes comprehensive validation queries

2. **`validate_data_consistency.py`**
   - Python script for ongoing data validation
   - Generates detailed JSON reports
   - Can be scheduled for regular monitoring

## Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Minor Goal Inconsistencies (4.64% of matches)
- 70 matches have minor goal discrepancies between tables
- Likely due to data entry issues or incomplete migrations
- Requires manual review of source data

### 2. Missing Team Performance Records (1.79% of matches)
- 28 matches lack complete team performance data
- Need to extract from original source or FBref data

### 3. Shot-Goal Discrepancies (0.75% of matches with shots)
- 7 matches where shot outcomes don't match recorded goals
- May indicate missing shot records or data quality issues

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Schedule `validate_data_consistency.py` to run daily
   - Set up alerts for consistency drops below 95%

2. **Address Remaining Issues**
   - Investigate and fix the 70 matches with goal inconsistencies
   - Extract missing team performance data for 28 matches
   - Review shot data for 7 matches with discrepancies

3. **Data Type Standardization**
   - Consider migrating all xG fields to NUMERIC(4,2) for consistency
   - Currently mix of REAL and NUMERIC causes comparison issues

4. **Documentation**
   - Update data dictionary with field relationships
   - Document business rules for data consistency

## SQL Queries for Ongoing Monitoring

```sql
-- Quick health check
SELECT * FROM v_xg_consistency_check WHERE consistency_status = 'INCONSISTENT' LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM v_goal_consistency_check WHERE consistency_status = 'INCONSISTENT' LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM v_match_team_record_check WHERE record_status != 'COMPLETE' LIMIT 5;

-- Summary statistics
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_xg_consistency_check WHERE consistency_status = 'CONSISTENT') as xg_consistent,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_goal_consistency_check WHERE consistency_status = 'CONSISTENT') as goals_consistent,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_match_team_record_check WHERE record_status = 'COMPLETE') as complete_records;
```

## Conclusion

The data consistency fixes have been successfully applied, achieving:
- **100% xG consistency** between tables for matches with shot data
- **95.36% goal consistency** across match and team performance tables
- **98.21% completeness** of team performance records

The database now has proper constraints and monitoring in place to maintain data integrity going forward.
