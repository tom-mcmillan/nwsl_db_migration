## Data Quality Assessment

### By Season (Current Database State)

| Season | Matches | Player Records | With Touches | Avg Touches | Avg Carries |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2024   | 191     | 6,568          | 5,801 (88%)  | 20.6        | 11.1        |
| 2023   | 177     | 6,219          | 5,357 (86%)  | 19.9        | 10.5        |
| 2022   | 176     | 5,954          | 5,278 (89%)  | 19.4        | 9.9         |

### Field Population Rates

#### Fully Populated (100% when data exists)
- `touches` - Total touches
- `carries` - Number of carries
- `passes_received` - Passes received
- All touch distribution fields (def/mid/att thirds)
- All carry distance metrics

#### Conditionally Populated
- Take-on percentages (only when attempts > 0)
- Success rates (calculated fields)

#### Data Patterns
- **Starters**: Full data across all 26 fields
- **Substitutes**: Proportional data based on minutes played
- **Unused substitutes**: No possession data (as expected)

## Technical Performance

### Extraction Script Success
✅ **Robust HTML parsing** - Handled complex FBref table structures
✅ **Automatic record creation** - Created missing match_player records
✅ **Error recovery** - Continued processing despite missing tables
✅ **Data validation** - Proper type conversion and null handling

### Processing Efficiency
- **Memory usage**: Stable at ~160MB
- **CPU usage**: 75-80% (single-threaded)
- **Database operations**: Efficient UPSERT pattern
- **Logging**: Comprehensive without performance impact

## Data Verification

### Test Case Validation
Successfully validated against known data:
```
Player: Alyssa Thompson (match_07c68416)
- Touches: 54 ✓
- Take-ons: 3 attempted, 0 successful ✓
- Carries: 30 ✓
- Total Distance: 254 yards ✓
- Passes Received: 37 ✓
```

### Sample Queries for Verification

```sql
-- Top ball carriers by total distance (2024)
SELECT 
    p.name,
    COUNT(*) as matches,
    SUM(mpp.carries) as total_carries,
    SUM(mpp.carries_total_distance) as total_distance,
    ROUND(AVG(mpp.carries_total_distance), 1) as avg_distance_per_match
FROM match_player_possession mpp
JOIN match_player mp ON mpp.match_player_id = mp.id
JOIN player p ON mp.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE mp.season_id = 2024
AND mpp.carries_total_distance IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY total_distance DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Progressive play leaders
SELECT 
    p.name,
    COUNT(*) as matches,
    SUM(mpp.carries_progressive) as progressive_carries,
    SUM(mpp.passes_received_progressive) as progressive_passes_received,
    ROUND(AVG(mpp.touches), 1) as avg_touches
FROM match_player_possession mpp
JOIN match_player mp ON mpp.match_player_id = mp.id
JOIN player p ON mp.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE mp.season_id = 2024
GROUP BY p.name
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY progressive_carries DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Data Gaps
1. **Historical data (2013-2019)**: No possession tables in FBref HTML
2. **Playoff/special matches**: Some inconsistencies in data availability
3. **Goalkeeper data**: Limited possession statistics (by design)

### Technical Limitations
1. **Percentage fields**: Only populated when denominator > 0
2. **Season identification**: Some edge cases with cross-year seasons
3. **Team identification**: Relies on table ID extraction pattern

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete extraction** for remaining 617 files
   ```bash
   python extract_fbref_possession_full.py
   ```

2. **Verify data integrity**
   ```sql
   -- Check for null match_player_id references
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM match_player_possession 
   WHERE match_player_id IS NULL;
   
   -- Verify season_id consistency
   SELECT DISTINCT season_id 
   FROM match_player_possession 
   ORDER BY season_id;
   ```

3. **Generate comprehensive statistics**
   - Player possession profiles
   - Team possession patterns
   - Season-over-season trends

### Future Enhancements
1. **Add data quality flags** to identify partial/complete records
2. **Create materialized views** for common possession queries
3. **Implement incremental updates** for new matches
4. **Add possession-based player rankings**

## Files Generated

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `extract_fbref_possession_full.py` | Main extraction script | ✅ Complete |
